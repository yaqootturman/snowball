## Problem Statement :

    You can’t have system change without individual change” – Greta Thunberg
    Individual climate action - the changes people make in their day-to-day lives - is the foundation of lasting action on climate
    change. The problem is, the supporting environment for taking individual action isn’t great. Here are the main problems:
    • Complexity – people don’t feel like they know what to do or who to listen to;
    • Lack of reward – climate action is inherently unrewarding - you don’t get the typical rewards that drive most human
    actions;
    • Isolation – individual action is generally lonely and isolated. You feel like most other people aren’t doing anything.
    There is no social recognition or social gain. It’s anonymous;
    • Low impact – the impact of each action is relatively unknown and, in isolation, is relatively small.
    Whilst these problems persist – change will be slow.
    We believe that climate action needs to be easier to take, more rewarding and more connected.

## The Solution :

    The app tells the user all the ways they can take climate action, on a simple, easy to navigate interface. The user can swipe to make a commitment to take that action (ie. ‘buy locally produced, seasonal food wherever possible’). They can then track the commitments they’ve made and the impact that they’ve had.
    Most importantly the app will show the user how many people, around the world, have already committed to each action
